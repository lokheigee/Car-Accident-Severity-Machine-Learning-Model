Zanlyn Yang (Responsible for writing the predictive model code) sent us an earlier (Wrong) version of the task code. 
He is at work as we hand this in. He is therefore unable to send us the proper code.

Because of this, the modelling code here does not produce the results we analyze in the report. In fact, (To my understanding) it is almost entirely unrelated to our report.

I will contact Zanlyn Yang and tell him to upload the proper code in his own submission (Which will be late).

I hope you can understand our situation.
